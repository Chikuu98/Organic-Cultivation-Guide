Lorenzo Cotula argues that, without clear decision-making rules and effective structures to manage power differentials, bringing diverse actors together produces ‘capture’ rather than inclusion.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs United Nations events go, the Food Systems Summit had a strangely synthetic feel.:&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>The virtual gathering of heads of state and government </strong>held alongside the UN General Assembly in New York – involved a carefully choreographed mix of glossy videos and read-out statements, facilitated by two presenters in a sleek television-style studio..&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Food politics – crucial and contested</strong>&nbsp;Food is the foundation of life, culture and identity. Food riots can destabilise governments and securing food supplies is a major political concern; milestones in global food diplomacy were triggered by major food crises.\r\n\r\nFood-related activities sustain billions of small-scale farmers, traders and workers. Substantial corporate interests are also at play, such as those of agribusiness, finance and technology companies. While power imbalances favour big industry, vibrant peasant movements have influenced international policy.\r\n\r\nFood systems knowledge is deeply divided on the challenges, and how to address them.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>A careful, fragile equilibrium</strong>&nbsp;The Committee on World Food Security (CFS) has been catering for this complexity. Housed in Rome at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN (FAO), CFS facilitates and regulates participation of diverse perspectives – FAO legal texts describe it as the “foremost inclusive international and intergovernmental platform” in food matters.\r\n\r\nWithin CFS, decision-making rests with states, but businesses and civil society hold participation rights through institutionalised ‘mechanisms’, while a diverse High-Level Panel of Experts distils evidence to inform deliberations.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p><em>written by: chiku98</em></p>\r\n', '2013-10-02', 1, '2021-10-03', 1, NULL, NULL, 0, '../assets/blogImg/blog3.jpg'),

The summit provides a real opportunity for reigniting the world’s collective ambition to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. :&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Population growth and food production:</strong>Sub-Saharan Africa’s (SSA) growing demand for food is putting huge pressure on forests and biodiversity. And with the region’s population set to double by 2050, fast-paced agricultural expansion is poised to continue – it is, rather than productivity growth, the main source of increased agricultural production. This necessitates calls for sustainable agricultural productivity growth in SSA.\r\n\r\nHere, I examine cropland expansion in SSA and identify practical steps and opportunities to address potential collisions between population growth, food security and conservation objectives.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Why do we need to reconcile food production and conservation?</strong>SSA has seen huge agricultural expansion over the last two decades. Over this period, around 75% of the region\'s crop production growth came from expansion of cultivated areas, and only 25% from improvements in crop yield.\r\n\r\nBetween 2001 and 2015, agricultural expansion by smallholder farmers accounted for 92% of Africa’s lost forest cover relative to a 2010 baseline. An additional 430 million hectares is estimated to be cleared for food production in SSA by 2060.\r\n\r\nIn a recent paper, my co-authors and I examined smallholder farmers’ cropland expansion in Zambia. Our findings showed it accounts for about 60% of the 250,000 hectares of forest lost annually in Zambia.&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong> Invest in better land use planning and land tenure</strong>&nbsp; Policy collisions may be minimised by coordinated land use planning across government ministries. For example, aims to increase agricultural production can be met by expanding cultivated areas into degraded forests rather than expanding into primary forests and biodiversity-rich habitats that may be earmarked for conservation.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, traditional farming systems that sustainably use forest resources to ensure food and nutrition security should be supported and incentivised through secure land tenure.\r\n\r\nReconciling food production and conservation need not be a choice between destroying forests and feeding fast-growing populations. Synergies and win-win outcomes are possible. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p><em>written by: Saman Perera</em></p>\r\n\r\n', '2021-10-15', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '../assets/blogImg/blog4.jpg'),

Because of lockdowns and the closing down of transport systems, people are forced to stay in their houses and cannot go out to earn.\r\n\r\nMaybe middle-class families can manage under these restrictions, but the urban poor who live day-to-day are really suffering – especially when it comes to food. With no income, families can\'t put food on the table and there is a lot of hunger.:&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Grassroots women and organisations are key to growth</strong>A short time back, a friend in the Quezon City municipal office called me and invited us to join a project our city\'s mayor, Joy Belmonte, was initiating in food sustainability.\r\n\r\nFood is our serious need now, so we were ready to join. The mayor has made urban farming a big part of her programme for the city, and she wanted to work with grassroots women and grassroots organisations to convert idle plots of land in the city into vegetable gardens.\r\n\r\nSo a small group of us started to look for vacant land in our parish to start a garden. About a kilometre away from my place in Payatas is the village of Amlac where we found a vacant lot of about 450 square metres. First we talked to the landowner, and then we talked to the president of the village to ask them if we could start cultivating that land. They agreed.\r\n\r\nWe started with only three women. I asked our parish priest to spread the word that if anybody wanted to join us, we were going to raise vegetables together on that empty land. As a result, more people joined us.&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong> From small shoots…</strong>&nbsp; Slowly, slowly, the vegetables that we planted grew – leafy greens, tomatoes, long beans, bitter gourds, aubergines, pumpkins, peppers, radishes, onions and even bananas. And our project kept growing too.\r\n\r\nNow our group of volunteer gardeners has grown to 38. We\'re mostly women, but some men have joined us too. We sell some of the vegetables to earn a little income, but most are for our members to take home, so they can put nutritious food on the table for their families.\r\n\r\nThe mayor visited our urban community garden in Amlac. She was so happy to see that even though people don\'t have work, and don\'t have any way of earning, and don\'t have enough money to buy things, they are happily harvesting the vegetables they had grown themselves. Food is not a problem for us now, because of the vegetables we grow in our garden. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p><em>written by: Edirimuni</em></p>', '2021-11-02', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '../assets/blogImg/blog2.jpg'),

Leadership styles have evolved overtime, with a clear shift from the bureaucratic and directive leadership style of the twentieth century to a more autonomous approach. Lines are becoming more and more blurred between person and professional goals. The new leadership paradigm works through emotions. When leaders drive emotions positively, they bring out everyone&rsquo;s best. The truth of the matter is that many business too this day still struggle with defining leadership at every level. Far too many people in managerial positions remain unwilling or unable to make the changes necessary to create a healthy, thriving enterprise capable of enduring. It is time for change; Akhtaboot presents the traits of successful leaders of today so that an organisation can position itself favourably for future success.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>They Invest In Their People</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many organisations hold back on Training &amp; Development programmes as they fear people might leave after they&rsquo;ve heavily invested in them. This might happen, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. However one of the main reasons why many people leave organisations is that they don&rsquo;t feel valued by their employers. Successful leaders don&rsquo;t just mouth empty phrases like &ldquo;people are our greatest assets&rdquo;, they demonstrate that by unlocking the untapped potential of their employees. They understand that by doing that they will gain an edge in recruiting and retaining top talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>They Free People from Boxes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Micromanagement is the paradigm of all, obsolete leadership style, the new paradigm frees people from boxes. It&rsquo;s all about helping people reach places they didn&rsquo;t know they could go. They understand that if they try to control everything employs do, they will end up feeling patronised and will begin to resent their jobs. The new leader will need to balance the roles of Boss, mediator and mentor allowing teams more freedom and autonomy while keeping them focussed on objectives.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>They Practice Transparency</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The easiest way to build trust with your employees is to be clear about what you are and aren&rsquo;t doing. Transparent leadership is a way of thinking and behaving everyday with every action, reaction and transaction. Fore transparent leadership to be effective, leaders must be humble, open, honest and straightforward. Transparent leadership is about engaging the passion of your employees and allowing them to generate ideas to help your business thrive. This also means that you should always give credit where when it is due.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Better Communication Leads to Better Results</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For leaders to succeed in today&rsquo;s business world they need to be great communicators. This is especially true when it comes to communicating performance expectations. They shouldn&rsquo;t assume and everyone knows as much as about the subject as they do; instead, they need to take the time to listen, explain and give a brief background on the subject at hand. Great leaders create an open environment that allows them to share their candid opinions freely. They show compassion and humility to make people feel heard. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that employees will like everything you have to say, but they will respect you and perform where you communicate early and often.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2021-11-03', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '../assets/blogImg/blog8.jpg'),

It is frustrating as it makes them wonder if their application was actually seen or if they did not make the cut. While some employers will occasionally give rejected candidates some feedback about where they need to improve or what went wrong, the majority of employers hold back on telling candidates why they were rejected. Whatever might be the reason for being rejected, you need to be prepared to increase your chances of getting the job. You can start by awarding the top job seeker behaviours employers hate. Akhtaboot reveals to top reasons employers will not share why they did not hire you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>You Exaggerate Your Qualifications</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It should always be noted that employers look for honesty in candidates. But many job seekers believe that there is no room for modesty when it comes to job searching. From exaggerating on your CV to never admitting even one weakness during the interview, any false information will be noticeable, as you might not be able to support the information you have presented. Employers will always prefer people who are open, honest and speak straight face-to-face.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>You Are Overqualified For The Position</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Giving the impression that you have more experience than the job requires will give the impression that you do not really understand what the job is all about. Hiring Managers will also assume that your salary expectations are probably higher than the role pays and they will disregard your application. The best thing that you can do in this situation is to understand these valid concerns and address them early on. Start by explaining why you are genuinely interested in the position and make it clear that you are fine with the lower pay that comes with the position.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>We Don&rsquo;t Like You</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Since personal characteristics are usually not part of the job description, when it comes down to finding the right candidate, the deciding factor may actually be &ldquo;likeability&rdquo;. No one wants to work with arrogant, negative, troublemakers who will not be able to get along with their colleagues. This is all about your ability to get along with your colleagues. You need to show the willingness and the ability to be harmonious with others; if you cannot do that, do not expect a callback.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>You Did Not Make A Great First Impression</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We often hear that first impressions matter. It actually could be the differentiating factor between you getting the job or not. During the interview, judgments are being made on both your appearance and behavious. From the way you shake hands to the way you smell, or the way you are dressed to the way you talk. This sounds obvious but you would be surprise how often people get it wrong. Depending on where you are interviewing, make sure that you come across as the perfect fit for the role. Make sure that you know how casual the company that you are interviewing at is; looking far too formal or under dressed for the company might give a negative vibe about your candidacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n', '2021-11-03', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '../assets/blogImg/blog9.jpg'),
(15, '2021-11-03', 'National Research Priorities on Organic Agriculture', 'National Research Priorities', '<p><em><strong>Getting the most of your employees often comes down to building a solid foundation of company trust.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Management</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It comes as no surprise that in order for people to follow, they need to trust their leaders. Employees just want the truth more than ever and they need their leaders to have their backs. If this is so, why is it that so many organizations struggle to achieve and maintain trust, yet fail to achieve commitment from their staff? Sadly, throughout the world, many people have real trust issues with their management, but what are the warning signs? Akhtaboot lists the warning signs of low trust to lookout for in an organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Avoiding Contradict</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Many employees chose not to standup for what they believe in and try to avoid conflict at all costs. They prepare not to voice their opinions as they are afraid to fail. These are all signs of lack of trust. Employees who try to avoid conflict hesitate to ask for help or to provide constructive feedback. This creates an environment where back-channel politics and personal attacks thrive. Another enemy of trust is selective communication. These occurs when only information that makes employees look good is communicated while &ldquo;bad news&rdquo; is delayed or avoided all together. When employees the courage to try to unleash their full potential that of others, it often becomes an challenge to trust their judgment and overall capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Hoarding Information</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>An evident sign of having trust issues is when employees act secretive, territorial, and cautious around other team members. Information hoarding can be a result of personal insecurity or from past delaying with unethical or discriminatory management. It should be a leader&rsquo;s top priority to make commination a commitment for each team member and assess them on this as a part of the annual review. Make sure that the team is recognized for collaborative results and not just individual achievements and ensure that all members know that team success is their priority.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>High Turnover</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Turnover is a major issue impacting the performance and profitability to many companies and it is a result of lack of trust. Organizations are increasingly taking proactive steps to build high trust cultures because it helps improve turnover rates. By extending trust to their employees, leaders can demonstrate their willingness to support them, which eventually leads to lower turnover rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Job Burnout</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Lack of trust leads to job burnout, exhaustion, depersonalization and feelings of being ineffective at work. If leaders do not strive to change that by creating a positive culture that energizes people, there will be consequences. To improve your employees&rsquo; moral you need to get inside their heads. Make transparency the norm; the more you communicate, the more you foster trust and the more loyalty built. Host frequent town hall meetings in which you listen to employees&rsquo; fears, concerns and ideas and share your vision for the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>They Don&rsquo;t Listen</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In order for employees to trust their company, they expect management to deliver on their promises and to be honest and open in all communications. If you fail to do that, they will stop listening to you. Be clear in letting employees know what you expect from them, and what they can expect of you in return. Put new policies in writing, and if you are changing standard operating procedures, be specific when you tell employees what the changes mean. Ask for input to show you are listening to their needs, which will set the stage for insisting they listen to you as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: www.akhtaboot.com</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2021-11-03', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '../assets/blogImg/blog10.jpg'),

This involves identifying problems the company faces, assigning a level of importance to each one, and assessing the kinds of changes needed to solve the problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Gain Unified Agreement</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For change to be implemented successfully, all concerned parties need to get involved to create enthusiasm and a sense of ownership among employees. You&nbsp; can also ask for the input of those who are not directly involved in the change as their support for the new plan can help employees feel more at ease. When the management team shows unified support for a newly introduced initiative, it is easier for employees to follow through with implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Introduce Change in Phases</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Do not go live with the change immediately. Place a structure for change, and continually check for obstacles and barriers. Addressing&nbsp; obstacles early on can empower the people you need to execute your vision, and it can help the change move forward. Have a small group of employees try the change first to identify any errors or alterations that need to be made. Once you do that, slowly integrate the change into your organization.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Monitor the Progress and Seek Feedback</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Be open for feedback and listen to any concerns your people may have. While some may not agree with certain changes simply because they were in the habit of doing things the old way, others may have smart and alternative solutions that you should consider. Implement employee-based feedback that seems valid so you can make the transition go more smoothly.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Incorporate the Change into the Company Culture</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your corporate culture often determines what gets done and what does not, so in order for any change to stick, it should be incorporated into the core of your company culture. Make continuous efforts to ensure that the change is seen in every aspect of your employees&rsquo; daily work. Talk about progress during weekly meetings and performance reviews. Tell success stories about the change process. It is also important that all of your company&rsquo;s leaders continue to support the change every step of the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Source: Akhthaboot - the career network</em></p>\r\n', '2021-11-03', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '../assets/blogImg/blog11.jpg'),

That&rsquo;s why many managers tend to take a reactive approach to handling employee mistakes. They have been taught how to give feedback and deal with conflict through corrective actions such as verbal or written warnings, and sometimes, termination. As a result, they often perceive handling employee mistakes as a confrontational situation and an inevitable part of being a manager. But this shouldn&rsquo;t always be the case as most mistakes can be avoided if the right precautions are taken in advance. Akthaboot offers several tips to help you limit employee errors in your company.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Set Clear Expectations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Setting expectations is one of the basic fundamentals of leadership; yet, many managers fail to make clear requests that have no room for interpretation. The first step towards setting clear expectations is planning. The more time you dedicate to planning, the more effective your team will be when they start executing. The second component of setting clear expectations requires great communication skills. Your employees want to be on the same page as you, they want to make smart decisions, but they cannot read minds. Rephrase your requests in a way that can be heard, often several times, before they become internalized by others.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Document Your Expectations</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Making clear requests is a great start when it comes to limiting employee mistakes, but over time people tend to forget what was agreed upon and you can still fall into the &ldquo;I said, he said&rdquo; trap. If you feel that your request can be misinterpreted from what you intended, make sure that you document it in writing or using electronic systems. There are many systems that allow you to assign tasks to employees while allowing them to ask questions, give updates, and request more information. It also gives you a point of reference if there is a problem later on.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Address Any Problems with Facts</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mistakes happen to the best employees and systems. Whether intentional or due to negligence. When the time to address mistakes with your team comes, you need to focus the team&rsquo;s&nbsp; attention on facts instead of feelings or personal issues. This doesn&rsquo;t mean that you need to eliminate any emotional charge out of the conversation; you need to tackle the mistake in a factual approach by referring back to the initial request and the documentation. By doing so, you will be able to pinpoint team members who didn&rsquo;t follow the brief from those who simply misunderstood the request.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>Document the Mistakes</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Smart companies know the difference between a lesson learned and finding a permanent solution for it. Learning a lesson from mistakes happens only when we take responsibility for the mistake, try different approaches to achieve different results, and then integrate best practices into the company&rsquo;s culture by documenting all cases. Create some type of knowledge management system, which could be as a simple as a spreadsheet. This sheet will allow you to document the mistakes, the causes and the solutions, and then you can create some type of standard operating procedures. Once you share it with your employees, make sure that you periodically refer to it to ensure that the lesson has truly been learned and similar mistakes are less likely to be repeated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>By akthaboot - the career network</em></p>\r\n', '2021-11-04', 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 0, '../assets/blogImg/blog12.jpg'),

It relies on ecological processes, biodiversity and cycles adapted to local conditions, rather than the use of inputs with adverse effects. Organic Agriculture combines tradition, innovation and science to benefit the shared environment and promote fair relationships and a good quality of life for all involved.”\r\n    \r\n    FAO suggested that “Organic agriculture is a unique production management system which promotes and enhances agro-ecosystem health, including biodiversity, biological cycles and soil biological activity, and this is accomplished by using on-farm agronomic, biological and mechanical methods in exclusion of all synthetic off-farm inputs”.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<strong>Need of organic farming</strong><br>With the increase in population our compulsion would be not only to stabilize agricultural production but to increase it further in sustainable manner. The scientists have realized that the ‘Green Revolution’ with high input use has reached a plateau and is now sustained with diminishing return of falling dividends. Thus, a natural balance needs to be maintained at all cost for existence of life and property. The obvious choice for that would be more relevant in the present era, when these agrochemicals which are produced from fossil fuel and are not renewable and are diminishing in availability. It may also cost heavily on our foreign exchange in future.\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\n<br />\r\n\r\n<p><em>written by: P.
